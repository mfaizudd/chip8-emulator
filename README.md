# Chip8 Emulator
This is just a hobby project to learn new stuff, because I'm curious about how do those people create such a complex emulator, so I want to learn emulator development, and I found out that chip-8 is the best way to start out, so here it is.
## Building
    mkdir build
    cmake ..
    make
## Usage
    ./chip8 ROM.ch8
